#### **6. Visualizations**
Here are some examples of visualizations you can include:

1. **Monthly Sales Trend**:
   ```python
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   import seaborn as sns

   plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
   sns.lineplot(x='Month', y='Sales', data=monthly_sales_data)
   plt.title('Monthly Sales Trend')
   plt.xlabel('Month')
   plt.ylabel('Sales ($)')
   plt.show()
   ```
   ![Monthly Sales Trend](https://via.placeholder.com/600x400) *(Replace with actual visualization)*

2. **Profitability by Product Category**:
   ```python
   plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
   sns.barplot(x='Product Category', y='Profit', data=product_profit_data)
   plt.title('Profitability by Product Category')
   plt.xlabel('Product Category')
   plt.ylabel('Profit ($)')
   plt.show()
   ```
   ![Profitability by Product Category](https://via.placeholder.com/600x400) *(Replace with actual visualization)*

3. **Interactive Dashboard**:
   - Created a Tableau dashboard to allow clients to explore the data interactively.
